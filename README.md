## Introduction

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. We have developed a predictive model that can help assess the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical attributes.

Key features of this project:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- Deployment using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Dataset

We used the [name of dataset] dataset for this project. It contains [number of instances] instances and [number of features] features. The dataset is available [here](link to dataset).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)
- Google Colab (for cloud-based development)
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
