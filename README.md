[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Introduction

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. A predictive model have been developed that can help assess the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- Deployment using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Spyder (for development)
- Google Colab (for cloud-based development)
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

- Sequentially execute this code

   ```bash
   - git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   - python -m venv venv
   - venv\Scripts\activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
- Data Exploration and Model Development: Use Google Collab to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, and develop machine learning models.
- To deploy the project locally, run the following command: streamlit run "location_of_file_with_.py".
- Project have been deployed using Streamlit, you can access the live demo [here](https://mlwebapp-ba3egy8nw4lt9vdnpt84bh.streamlit.app/).
