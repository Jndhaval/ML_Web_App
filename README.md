[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Introduction

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. A predictive model have been developed that can help assess the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical attributes.

## Dataset
I used the [Heart Disease] dataset for this project. The dataset was taken from kaggle.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
- Machine learning model development and evaluation.
- Deployment using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x
- Spyder (for development)
- Google Colab (for cloud-based development)
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
